Here the move to do it: You need a Raspbian distribution, i used the one from my Linapple from reactivemicro wiki i built previously downloading it here:https://wiki.reactivemicro.com/Linapple_Raspberrypi booting it and from terminal i wrote sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get upgrade after it, removing with sudo nano etc/rc.local the executable pom1 string from terminal window. Then i have set the monitor to a lover 16:9 resolution with sudo raspi-config from terminal. I have also configured the keyboard to us layout like mine from sudo raspi-config from terminal then localisation then keyboard layout. Ok now.....

download microM8

expand it in Download folder.

Now make it start at boot:

write this in terminal: sudo nano /home/pi/.config/autostart/clock.desktop

and copy paste this code with mouse click

[Desktop Entry] Type=Application Name=TIC-80 Exec=/home/pi/Downloads/microM8 --fullscreen

press control X and Yes and return

go to the raspberry menu and open preferences-Main menu editor-Preferences and mark the Desktop Session Settings

click ok

Go to Menu Preferences-Desktop Session Settings-and mark microM8

reboot

It should go!!!!

Enjoy your new microM8 Computer
